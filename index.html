	  <h1 align="center">Motivation for studying Computer Science and Engineering</h1>
	  <h1>Cse:</h1>
	<h3>1.You Have More Options</h3>
<p>In the past, computer science students often had to settle for courses that were held close to where they lived.
This meant you often could not complete a higher quality course, 
unless you were willing to relocate or travel long distances to attend lectures. </p>
<p>Thankfully the internet has solved this problem and most of the world’s leading colleges and universities offer their courses online. 
This means it’s as easy to start a high-quality course,
 like a masters in computer science online as it is to enroll in a less prestigious course locally. </p>
<h3>2.Your Education is More Affordable</h3>
<p>Completing a computer course can be expensive, especially if you have to travel to a college or a university every day.
 The fees for courses are not too cheap either, so it only makes sense to complete an online course which is much more affordable.
 For instance, an online masters in computer science program will cost much less than a traditional classroom based computer course where you have to attend lectures on a regular basis.</p>
<h3>3.      You Can Study Anywhere in the World</h3>
<p>It’s not always the ideal situation to have to travel to a college or university every day. As well as this,
 many students may not be able to study in the same location all of the time or may want to travel while they study.
 Online courses can be accessed anywhere in the world, so this is the perfect solution.<p>
<h3>4.      It is More Flexible and there Are Less Restrictions</h3>
<p>Traditional classroom based courses have certain restrictions that many people are not comfortable with.
 For example, you have to attend lectures at specific times, coursework has to be submitted at certain times and lecturers often have other rules that you may not agree with.
 This is not the case with online computer courses because you have much more freedom to study the way you want to study and you can study when you want to study.</p>
<h3>5.      All the Resources You Need Are Close at Hand</h3>
<p>All the resources you will ever need to help you with your computer course can be found online.
 This means you have all the research resources close at hand while you study your online computer course.
 This is a much more seamless way to study than having to attend lectures and then having to go online to find certain resources later on.<p>
<p>As you can see, it makes sense to complete a computer course online. This is because you have more options, it’s more affordable,
 you can study anywhere, it’s a more flexible way to study and all the study resources you need will be close at hand.<p>

<h1>My Future plan:</h1>
<p>Program is interesting thing. You can be done a work by machine for this you have to order the machine, but machine can’t know your language. As a result, command the machine you have to say it through machine language. By program you can ask the machine to work. For those reason I want to be a smart programmer. Besides it is also a creative art.</p>
